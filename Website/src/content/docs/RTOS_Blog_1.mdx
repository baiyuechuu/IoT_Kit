## Step 1 : Download Extention PlatformIO IDE on VsCode

![Extention Setup](/content/Blog1/extention.png)
---
## Step 2 : Click on the Platform IO Icon on the VScode taskbar, then select open to open the main interface of Platform IO

---
## Step 3 : Select New project to create a new project

![create projcet](/content/Blog1/Newproject.png)

### Project Wizard Interface Overview:

- Name: Enter a name for the project. (Note: The name should not contain spaces or special characters, and it must not start with a number.)
- Board: Select the board you will use to upload code. (There are many boards available, but since this project uses the ESP32, choose the board DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1.)
- Framework: PlatformIO supports two main frameworks: Arduino and ESP-IDF. (Aselect the ESP-IDF framework.)
- Location: Choose the location to save your project. (You can either check the box to use the default location — usually inside the Documents folder on Windows — or uncheck it to select a custom location.)

- We will wait a few minutes for the IDE to setup the framework environment and generate the necessary files for the project.
---
## Step 5 Explore inside the project folder
![inside Project](/content/Blog1/insideProject.png)

- The main.c file in the src folder is where the main code of the project will be written.
- The lib folder is used to store the libraries (usually in .zip or extracted format) required by the project.
- The platformio.ini file is where we configure project settings, such as the platform, framework, monitor speed, upload speed, and other build flags or parameters.

Example main.c 
```C
#include "FreeRTOS.h"
#include "task.h"
#include <stdio.h>

void ExampleTask(void *pvParameters) {
    while (1) {
        printf("Hello world\n");
        vTaskDelay(pdMS_TO_TICKS(2000)); 
    }
}

void app_main() {
    xTaskCreate(
        ExampleTask,    
        "mytask",      
        1024,            
        NULL,            
        1,              
        NULL            
    );
}
```

---
## Step 6 Upload and Monitor
![upload Project](/content/Blog1/upload.png)

- Press Ctrl + P to open the workspace, then type > to access the PlatformIO options.
- Search for or select the "Upload and Monitor" option.
- Plug in your board and wait for a while — the code will be uploaded to the board and the output will be displayed in the monitor, allowing you to observe the program’s status.

## MenuConfig
### Option 1 : Adjust via menuconfig interface

ESP-IDF provides a configuration tool called menuconfig, which allows you to customize many project parameters, such as task priority, stack size, CPU frequency, and more. This is where you can fine-tune system behavior to fit your needs.

![menuconfig ](/content/Blog1/menuconfig.png)

A menuconfig window appears in the project terminal: select component config → FreeRTOS → Kernel to tweak the FreeRTOS config

![inside menuconfig](/content/Blog1/inside_menuconfig.png)

To activate a function, select the spcae key when the * sign appears, then confirm the function activation is successful.

### Option 2 : Adjust via menuconfig file 

Go to the FreeRTOSConfig.h file located at the following path: C:\Users\yourusername\.platformio\packages\framework-espidf\components\freertos\config\include\freertos
